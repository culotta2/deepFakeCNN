This quiz is part of a STAT 430 DLP Deep Learning Project. Thanks for taking the time to take it.

The goal of this quiz is for you to identify which images of the people in the "images" folder are photographs of actual people, and which
are images generated by a machine. The type of machine that generated these images is called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

In order to take this quiz, please fill out (in the "quiz.csv" file) whether you think each image is genuine or generated by
the machine. To specify which, next to the image number please put 1 if you believe the image is genuine, or 0 if you believe the image is machine generated. 

If you have any questions, please reach out to either of the following (real) people, or check out the github for this project at https://github.com/culotta2/deepFakeCNN
