# deepFakeCNN
This a project for Stat 430: Fudamentals of Deep Learning at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

We are training a convolutional Neural Network for determining real vs fradulent images. Half of the data used are images of real people, and half are fake 
individuals generated by a Generative adversarial network (called StyleGAN).
The dataset used to train this model is called [140k Real and Fake Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
